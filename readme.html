<h1>Superstore Sales Data Analysis</h1>

<p>This documentation summarizes three key analyses performed using Python and related data science libraries. The analyses include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pareto Analysis</strong> of product sub-categories by profit.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Series Analysis</strong> of sales and profit over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong> between discount and profit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Pareto Analysis</h2>
<p>This analysis follows the <em>80/20 rule</em> to identify which product sub-categories contribute the most to the overall profit. By sorting and calculating cumulative profit percentages, we visualize which few categories drive most of the profitability.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A small number of sub-categories contribute disproportionately to the overall profit, supporting the Pareto principle.</p>

<h2>2. Time Series Analysis</h2>
<p>We analyzed trends in sales and profit over time using line plots on monthly aggregated data. This helps understand seasonality and long-term business performance.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Sales tend to show seasonal patterns, and there are fluctuations in profitability that require further investigation for decision-making.</p>

<h2>3. Discount vs Profit</h2>
<p>Using scatter plots and linear regression, we examined the relationship between discounts offered and the resulting profit.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> There is a weak to moderate negative correlation between discount and profit, suggesting that high discounts often reduce profitability.</p>
